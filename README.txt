This is a project to retrieve email status information using the SocketLabs API.

For examples from SocketLabs themselves, refer to their github repo: https://github.com/socketlabs/

Set up for the feeds:
	Upon installation, tabs will appear at the top of the home page. Each of these tabs
	refers to different feeds, or different API calls. You can click on a tab, click import,
	and enter the URL required for the API call. The format for the URL should be something
	like: https://username:password@api.socketlabs.com/...
	You can refer to https://www.socketlabs.com/od/api for the API reference.
